                <h4>
                    Hi, my name is Sameer and I'm a computer science student
                    at <a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Queen Mary University of London (QMUL)</a>.
                    I am also a programmer and I like to create solutions to problems. I also quite a love for
                    technology especially how fast it's advancing along with all of the cool things being released
                    everyday.
                    <br><br>
                    I have multiple hobbies which include; watching movies, gaming, and of course programming.
                    My top favourite movie would be <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12593682/" target="_blank">Bullet Train</a>, 
                    I really love the plot to the graphics to the characters, all of it
                    is just amazing when put together. I don't exactly have a favourite genre either, a bit of everything is great.
                    Also I don't have a favourite game either as I enjoy a bit of everything.
                    <br><br>
                    My favourite programming langugage would probably be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Java</a>, 
                    although there's a lot of boiler plate on it it's still great when it comes to creating software and it's a language I know quite well.
                    My second favourite programming language would probably be C/C++, they're just so interesting the way they work and how much control they give you,
                    and no i'm not a fan of Python, I just dislike it's simplicity and prefer curly brackets.
