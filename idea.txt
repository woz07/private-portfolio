IDEA:

The things that display the 'about me', 'education' and 'projects'
should have like a box underthem with some sort of shadow
which shows like that they're on some sort cool thing.
It needs to look somewhat neo like, use the purples I have

dont want it anymore

FINISH OFF CLEANING UP
THEN FOCUS ON MY SKILLS
THEN PROJECTS THEN FOCUS ON FOOTER

ALSO CONSIDER IF I SHOULD CHANGE FONT, THIS IS QUITE UNREADABLE AND UGLY.
